# Computational_Gastronomy_Tasks
## Task 1
Store Recipe Data in given format, analyse the recipe size distribution and ingredient rank distribution using plots
## Task 2
Implement copy-mutate algorithm (with only ingredient replacement) using appropriate parameters and also improvise the algorithm to incorporate ingredient addition or deletion besides ingredient replacement
## Task 3
Implement Apriori Algorithm to understand frequent ingredient pairings and also implement random controls 0 (preserves number of ingredients, number of recipes and recipe size distribution across the entire data) and random control 1 (besides preserving the parameters above, also preserving ingredient popularity across the data)
## Note
The same train.json file (as seen in Task 1) has been utilized as the data for all the 3 tasks.
